1-What is a smart contract? How are they deployed? You should be able to describe how a smart contract is deployed and the necessary steps.
1)Smart contracts are computer programs that can carry out transactions and agreements between anonymous parties in a
 reliable and consistent manner and cannot be changed retrospectively. It does not need a central authority, legal system or external enforcement mechanism. 
Because smart contracts eliminate intermediary institutions and organizations, they are fast and cost-effective. 
It is highly secure as it is encrypted with software algorithms and kept in distributed ledgers (remix, hardhat).
2-what is gas? Why is gas optimization such a big focus when creating smart contracts?
2)Ethers can be held in accounts or smart contracts. The commission to be paid for each calculation step required to register or 
run contracts in the system is called gas. The highest commission we are willing to pay is also called the gas limit. In the Ethereum blockchain, gas refers to the
 cost required to execute a transaction on the network. The lower gas we optimize the codes, the more we save
3- What is hash? Why do people use hash to hide information?
3) A hash function is an algorithm or subroutine that maps variable-length datasets to fixed-length datasets. It is used because it is very safe.
4-How would you prove to a colorblind person that two different colored objects are actually of different colors? You could check out 
Avi Wigderson talk about a similar problem 
4)Of course with zero knowledge proof this is very easy and possible
